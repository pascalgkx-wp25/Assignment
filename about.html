            <h2>What Are Our Goals?</h2>
            <p>
                We share your passion. Symphony Steps has many experienced instructors who find teaching music just as rewarding as students find learning and growing step by step.
            </p>
            <p>
                We aim to create a safe and welcoming musical environment for every learner, allowing them to explore their talent, hard work, and creativity.
            </p>
            <p>
                We help learners build confidence and achieve the skills needed to perform in a band concert in front of a large audience.
